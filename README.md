# Predicting Dutch Speaking Proficiency in Adult Language Learners

This project predicts the speaking proficiency of adult learners taking the State Examination of Dutch as a Second Language (STEX) using machine learning models. The dataset, originally compiled by Schepens, van Hout, and Jaeger (2020) and available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/adult-language-learning-profile/data?select=stex.csv), contains anonymized exam results and demographic information of learners residing in the Netherlands.

Our analysis reveals that enrolling in Dutch language courses is the strongest predictor of speaking proficiency, while passive exposure has little impact unless combined with active learning. Native Germanic speakers perform best, whereas Non-Germanic speakers face greater challenges. Monolingual individuals struggle more, while those with a second language, especially a Germanic one, have an advantage. General formal education has minimal influence, reinforcing that structured Dutch language learning is far more effective than overall schooling background.

Policy recommendations include expanding access to Dutch courses, offering tailored support for high-risk language groups, promoting early exposure programs, and encouraging multilingual education. Future work should explore longitudinal studies, personalized learning plans, and predictive AI tools to optimize language acquisition strategies.
